# Devolutionizer - Process Dialogue

## 2025-02-14 Csongor: Let's do this!

Ohnooo, why this title?!  
I had to pick one for the repository, I'm really afraid it's going to stick. We'll need to find another one.  

Hey Haniyeh,  
Sorry for doing it like this, just opening a repo. I still feel that you are looking for your right role in Devolution, and among many other things, I feel strongly that this could be a good one.  

But what do I mean? At the core:  
https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/blob/main/process/dialogue.md#2025-01-24-csongor-devolutionizer  
Would you be interested?

The more I think about it, it has to be a kind of two-step system, as light as possible:

1. **Editor** that "eats" a repository and allows the curator/researcher to select certain commits to highlight, and maybe some additional settings to analyse/exhibit the repository, and maybe some other settings to customise the design.
2. **Player**, which allows a visitor/researcher to play the different (selected) versions, compare them, check additional info about the repo. As our main concern now are the games of Pippin Barr: maybe directly in the browser (fullscreen, 2 screens?).

Lots of open questions, for sure.  
What do you think?
